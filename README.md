### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently an AI Content Developer at City University of Seattle, where I design learning experiences that make complex technical concepts clear and engaging. This role has strengthened my passion for bridging the gap between advanced technology and human understanding.

This fall, Iâ€™ll begin my next chapter as a DoD Cyber Scholarship (CySP) Scholar, pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Cybersecurity. My focus will be on developing secure, resilient systems by combining my background in computer science with a growing expertise in cybersecurity and AI.

One recent project involved implementing a SQLite database from scratch and experimenting with data structures for neural networksâ€”a personal exploration I hope to expand into a future Meetup series.
